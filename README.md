# Weather Application
- I have developed web based application which depicts free weather information of the location you type in textbox.
- Also, the AccuWeather API has been implemented in order to view temperature and weather information of the particular location.
- The AccuWeather API used here is the free version. Due to this reason, only 50 requests per day can be made using the API Key.
- To change the API Key use the below guide:
  ``` 
  /scripts/forecast.js
    Go to the line 1
      const key= "Paste Your Key Here";
  ```
